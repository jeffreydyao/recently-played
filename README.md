Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/), [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) and the [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) + [MusicKit](https://developer.apple.com/musickit/) APIs. 

## Getting Started
You can either clone the repo locally or deploy on Vercel. **In both cases, you must store the Spotify / MusicKit API keys as environmental variables for the app to function properly.**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **An enrolled Apple Developer account is required for Apple Music song search to function.**  
> Without one, you'll still be able to get each song's Spotify URL, but the Apple Music option will appear greyed out. 

### Option 1: Deploy on Vercel (recommended)
Click the button below. For env variable values, refer to the [setup section](#a-name%22setup%22aenvironmental-variables-setup) below. After setup you'll get a link to your app.

// TODO: Modify button to make Apple Developer env variables optional

### Option 2: Local setup
Clone the repo and setup a new .env.local file. For values, refer to the [setup section](#setup) below.

    // Spotify - required for app to function
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=VALUE
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=VALUE
    SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=VALUE
    // Apple Music - optional for Apple Music song search
    APPLE_DEVELOPER_TEAM_ID=VALUE
